Demo2 contains code for Demo 2.

'Demo2.py' is pi code for camera and movement parameters
'demoTwoo.ino' is arduino code for robot forward/angular movement
Connect Pi to Arduino via I2C, see Pi code for detail.
Arduino setup requires Analog pins, but is otherwise identical to Demo 1.

Devin/Yuxi -arduino team, refine movement precision, include start/stop parameters
Travis/Alex - pi team, establish output for arduino movement functions, and refine camera setup

Arduino team status:  DONE
